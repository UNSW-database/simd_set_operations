# Multiple experiments may operate on a single dataset.

# Processing considerations:
# - Reuse data from other experiments if algorithms overlap?
#   later - doesn't work with critereon graphs.
# - Performance in terms of other algorithms?
# - Group by dataset, experiment is only used for later processing.
